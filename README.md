- This script remaps the middle mouse button to scroll in VS Code
- Scrolling is vertical by default and horizontal if `Shift` is pressed
- Hold down the middle mouse button to start scrolling and release it to stop
- Release the middle mouse button without scrolling to scroll without holding it down
- Customize scroll behaviour by changing the constants at the top of the script
- You can use this script in other applications by changing the line that says `Code.exe`

Instructions:

- Download AutoHotkey
- The script can be run by opening it in the file explorer
- If you want it to be opened automatically, you can put it in the startup folder on your computer
